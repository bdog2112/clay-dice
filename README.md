# CLAY DICE
Sometimes you just gotta roll the dice and let the chips fall where they may.

This is a dice rolling project that, in its current form, allows you to roll 4, 6 and 20-sided dice. They launch with satisfying speed and settle quickly. But, not before bouncing wildly off the walls!

Add/remove dice with "+/-". Up to 8 dice can be added! Change die-type with "4" for 4-sided,  "6" for 6-sided and "2" for 20-sided.

If dice land on top of each other, then the top one is automatically re-rolled after a brief settling period. A numeric result is also displayed at the top of the screen.

FUTURE GOALS:
- Add 8, 10 and 12-sided dice
- Add hotkeys to change die-type
  - 1 for 10-sided
  - 2 for 20-sided
  - 3 for 12-sided
  - 4 for 4-sided
  - 6 for 6-sided
  - 8 for 8-sided
- Enable player to change color of dice
- Enable toggle of " window always on top"
- Enable adjustment of "dice settling time"
- Add ability to save settings
- Save window position/state
- Create new and improved textures
- Further develop motif and environment

STRETCH GOALS:
- Add sound effects
- Decorate dice rolling area, perhaps, with Vegas-style markings
- Highlight mesh faces that represent each die result

COMPLETED:
- Implemented 4, 6 and 20-sided dice
- Displayed (some) hotkeys
- Added fullscreen toggle
- Increased physics iterations and precision
- Enabled rolling multiple dice
- Enabled adding/removing dice
- Enabled switching between die types
- Added bevels to dice

OUT OF SCOPE:
- TBD
